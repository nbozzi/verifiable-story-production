# Verifiable Story Production (VSP)

**A governance framework for auditability and defensibility in AI-assisted media production.**

VVerifiable Story Production (VSP) is a governance and process standard for professional, AI-assisted storytelling workflows.
It addresses a core industry shift:

> From asking **“Is it real?”** to asking **“Is it defensible?”**

VSP treats generative media production as a **verifiable supply-chain problem**, not a creative black box.

## What VSP Solves

Generative AI has entered development, production, post-production, marketing, and distribution.
What is missing is not better output - but **defensible, auditable process integrity**.

VSP enables productions to be defensible:

- in court  
- to clients, broadcasters, and commissioning editors  
- to insurers (e.g. Errors & Omissions)  
- to regulators (e.g. EU AI Act Art. 50)  
- when something goes wrong

## Core Architecture

VSP is built on **Phase 0** and **four operational pillars**:

### Phase 0 — Human Intent Declaration (HID)
A timestamped, immutable record proving that human creative intent existed **prior to machine inference**  
(Proof of Anteriority).

### Pillar I — Sovereign Ingest
Control of models, tools, and data sources via a **Model Bill of Materials (Model-BoM)**.

### Pillar II — Constitutional Guardrails
Pre-generation constraints that limit the system’s capability space  
(negative constraints, style locks, ethical red lines).

### Pillar III — Persistent Provenance
Traceability through embedded credentials (C2PA) where available,  
or hash-linked generation logs (“hard-binding”) where embedding is unavailable.

### Pillar IV — Human-in-the-Loop Validation
Formal accountability gates where named human roles explicitly assume responsibility.

## What VSP Is — and Is Not

**VSP is:**
- a governance framework  
- a production standard  
- a decision and audit layer  
- tool-agnostic and jurisdiction-aware  

**VSP is not:**
- a software tool  
- a generative model  
- automated legal advice  
- an aesthetic or moral scoring system  

VSP evaluates **defensibility**, not creativity.
